# pnmp - That Next Gen Node.JS Package Manager, for Educational Purposes

Definitely not to be confused with [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) when using `npx`:

```
$ npx pnmp

Touched /Users/asyrjasalo/tralala, likely it did not replace npm.
```

Note: This package is 100% harmless.

## Release notes

I am a Finnish man and no I have absolutely no idea where the name came up from.
